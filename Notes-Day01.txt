! Unit 1: Program Neural Networks with TensorFlow 

    ! Stage : 1 The Hello World of Machine Learning 

        % Why should wer use Machine Learning 

            #What is AI : Understanding The surrounding Obseving Best Posssiblitliy
            #What is ML : Tell How to Answer (Stucture of the Output)
            #What is DL : Choose The Possiblitliy
            
            #Technology Use : TensorFlow , Numpy , Keras
            #language Use : Python

            #Keras Use For Build Neural Networks 


            !! Assignment : Devloper a Neural Networks which pridict a House selling price which in return favarable for real E-states buisness 
            !! if 1 bhk flat cost 10000 Rs , 2bhk flat cost : 10500 Rs , 3bhk flat cost Furture So , On 500 Rs will be incermented for additional bhks' (find out Price of 7 bhk)
            !! Post 30 Days your ml model will be depolyed into real states buisness , Now builders want to sell 10 BHK House to a coustumer . Preper a Machince Learning Model which can perdict the Price
